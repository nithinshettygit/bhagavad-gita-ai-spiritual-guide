# FastAPI and Uvicorn
fastapi==0.111.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.30.1 # Listed once and correctly

# Core Python libraries
python-dotenv==1.0.1
pandas
pydantic==2.8.2 # Keep pinned if you need this specific version, otherwise unpin

# AI/ML Specific Libraries
torch # Assuming you have CUDA or CPU setup for torch
sentence-transformers # No specific pin, allow latest compatible
faiss-cpu==1.8.0 # Keep pinned, specific FAISS versions can be tricky

# LangChain and all its related integration packages
# **** IMPORTANT: NO VERSION PINS HERE ****
# This allows pip to install the latest compatible versions for each,
# which should resolve the dependency conflicts and ensure InMemoryChatMessageHistory works.
